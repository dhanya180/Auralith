# 🧠 Auralith – Intelligent Supply Chain Optimization

Global supply chains are vulnerable to unpredictable disruptions, costing companies *6–10% of annual revenue, causing **inventory waste*, and damaging brand reputation.

Retailers alone face *\$470B in losses annually* due to inaccurate demand forecasts, overstocking, and forced markdowns. If we can mitigate even *1% of that, it’s a **\$4.7B* opportunity.

*Auralith* is our AI-powered, modular, and scalable platform designed to revolutionize supply chain resilience through real-time data, anomaly detection, and predictive simulation.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔄 Real-Time Data Ingestion

* Streams live data from sensors (e.g., transportation units), inventory systems, and more.
* Ensures immediate visibility across the supply chain.

### 🧹 Data Processing Service

* Cleans and enriches raw feeds.
* Ensures data is high-quality and analytics-ready.

### ⚠ AI-Based Anomaly Detection

* Instantly flags abnormal patterns using ML and heuristic methods.
* Detects issues like supplier delays, inventory mismatches, or shipping bottlenecks.

### 🤖 Smart Autonomous Action & Human Feedback Loop

* Advanced AI proposes solutions (e.g., rerouting, repricing) with measurable outcomes.
* Experts review and approve in real-time.
* System learns from outcomes using *Reinforcement Learning* for continuous improvement.

### 📊 Predictive Simulation Engine

* Runs thousands of parallel "what-if" scenarios in real time.
* Forecasts seasonal spikes, transportation issues, and market disruptions.
* Uses data from weather forecasts, social media trends, web traffic, and more.

### 🧠 Reinforcement Learning-Driven Decision Making

* Learns from feedback and outcomes to fine-tune future responses.
* Improves demand forecasts and stock-level decisions over time.

### 📝 Complete Traceability with Live System Logs

* Every anomaly, action, and feedback is timestamped and recorded.
* Ensures transparency and auditability.
